# Day 4: AWS Networking (VPC)
I dedicated Day 4 to expanding my knowledge of AWS networking concepts, with a specific focus on Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This deep dive allowed me to understand how to create and configure VPCs, subnets, and route tables, empowering me to design and manage robust network infrastructures for applications.
Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished and learned:

* 		VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
    * Explored the fundamental concept of VPC in AWS, which provides a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud dedicated to my project's resources.
    * Learned how VPC enables complete control over network configurations, including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.

    *    
    * * 		Subnets:
    * Understood the importance of subnets within a VPC and how they help in organising and segregating resources.
    * Learned how to create subnets with specific IP address ranges to facilitate efficient resource allocation.
    * Discovered the benefits of subnetting, such as enhanced security, availability, and scalability.
* 		Route Tables:
    * Explored the role of route tables in managing traffic within a VPC.
    * Learned how to create and configure route tables to control network traffic flow.
    * Discovered the concept of route prioritisation and how it affects the path of network traffic.

    * 
    * Network Infrastructure Design and Management:
    * Developed a comprehensive understanding of designing and managing network infrastructures for applications in AWS.
    * Learned how to architect VPCs, subnets, and route tables to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and security.
    * Explored best practices for deploying applications within a VPC, including considerations for availability zones, internet gateways, NAT gateways, and security groups.
Throughout Day 4, I gained hands-on experience by actively creating and configuring VPCs, subnets, and route tables within AWS. By mastering these essential networking concepts, I am now equipped to design and manage the network infrastructure for my applications effectively.
These newfound skills will prove invaluable to recruiters, as they demonstrate my ability to create robust and scalable network architectures in AWS, ensuring reliable and secure application deployments.
