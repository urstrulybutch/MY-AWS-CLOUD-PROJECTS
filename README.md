# Day 3: EC2 Instances
I dived into EC2, which provides virtual servers in the cloud. I learnt how to launch EC2 instances, connect to them using SSH, and understand key concepts such as instance types, security groups, and key pairs.
My First AWS Project: Deployed a simple web application(such as jenkins) on the ec2 instance and access the application from outside AWS.
