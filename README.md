I explained the concepts of private and public cloud, outlined the reasons why companies are migrating to the public cloud, and discuss the benefits associated with cloud adoption. Additionally, I will provide an overview of key AWS services and their relevance to DevOps practices. Finally, I will offer guidance on setting up an AWS account and navigating the AWS Management Console.
