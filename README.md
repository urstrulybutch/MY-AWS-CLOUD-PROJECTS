Day 6: AWS Route 53
For Day 6 of my AWS cloud project, I focused on working with AWS Route 53, a highly scalable and reliable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. During this day, I successfully configured and managed a domain name using Route 53. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished and learned:
* 		Domain Registration:
    * Registered a domain name through Route 53, allowing me to establish a unique online identity for my project.
    * Explored the process of registering a domain, including domain availability checks and registration fees.
* 		DNS Record Management:
    * Set up and managed DNS records to direct traffic to the appropriate resources.
    * Created various types of DNS records such as A records, CNAME records, and MX records, enabling proper routing of domain requests.
    * Learned how to configure TTL (Time to Live) values to control caching behavior and improve performance.
* 		Advanced Features:
    * Explored advanced features provided by Route 53 to enhance the reliability and availability of my application.
    * Utilized health checks to monitor the health of resources and automatically route traffic away from unhealthy endpoints.
    * Learned about routing policies such as simple routing, weighted routing, latency-based routing, and geolocation routing, which allow for sophisticated traffic management strategies.
    * Implemented DNS-based failover to redirect traffic to alternate resources in the event of failures, ensuring high availability.
By actively configuring and managing a domain name using Route 53, I gained hands-on experience in DNS management and the utilization of advanced features. This allowed me to ensure the proper routing, reliability, and availability of my project's resources.
