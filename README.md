# Day 5: AWS Security

Continuing my GitHub project, Day 5 focused on security best practices in AWS. I delved into the implementation of various security measures to uphold the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of AWS resources. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished and learned:

# Security Group inbound rules allowed

* 		Security Groups:
    * Explored the concept of security groups, which act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic for AWS resources.
    * Learned how to create and configure security groups to allow or deny specific types of traffic based on port numbers, protocols, and source/destination IP addresses.
    * Implemented security group rules to restrict access and enhance the security posture of AWS resources.
* 		Network ACLs (Access Control Lists):
    * Understood the role of network ACLs in controlling traffic at the subnet level in a VPC.
    * Learned how to create and configure network ACLs to allow or deny traffic based on rules.
    * Explored the order of evaluation for network ACL rules and their impact on network traffic.
* 		IAM (Identity and Access Management) Policies:
    * Explored IAM policies as a crucial component of AWS security, governing access to AWS resources.
    * Learned how to create and manage IAM policies to define permissions and access levels for users, groups, and roles.
    * Implemented the principle of least privilege to ensure that users have only the necessary permissions required to perform their tasks.
* 		Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:
    * Understood the importance of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) in information security.
    * Explored how to implement security measures in AWS to safeguard the confidentiality of data, maintain data integrity, and ensure the availability of resources.
    * Learned about encryption techniques, data protection mechanisms, backup and disaster recovery strategies, and monitoring tools to enhance security and resilience.
By focusing on security best practices, I demonstrated my ability to implement robust security measures in AWS. Through the effective use of security groups, network ACLs, and IAM policies, I ensured the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of AWS resources. These skills showcase my commitment to maintaining a secure environment for applications and sensitive data.
